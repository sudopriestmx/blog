Hi! I'm a Senior Back-End Developer, mostly experienced with the Node.JS Framework, JavaScript, and TypeScript. I've also some experience on Front-End development, mostly with AngularJS (back in the days before Angular 2+... 🕐), plus some foundational knowledge in VueJS (Currently trying to learn more 👀).

I'm passionate about development of performant APIs ⏱️, the challenge of designing systems that scale well 📈, and optimizing already existing systems whenever possible 📊, always following best practices and ensuring long term maintainability. I'm also passionate about the open source world, learning how my day to day tools work internally, following the process and development of features, and how maintainers interact and work with each other to provide a greater ecosystem for everyone 🤝. I look forward to the opportunity to become a maintainer myself in the future and give back to the community that provided the tools I use to make a living 🤩.

When I'm not working on software development, I'm probably honing my home barista skills ☕️. I enjoy all things coffee, discovering new techniques, brewing methods, beans from different sources and processes, and (trying) to make latte art on top of my flat whites 😅.

I'm also the proud husband of [Annaquarelles](https://annaquarelles.com), a beautiful and talented watercolor artist 🎨. You can find her on [Instagram](https://instagram.com/annaquarelles) and contact her for commisions or watercolor illustration editorial work 🤩.
